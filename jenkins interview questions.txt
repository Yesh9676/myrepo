jenkins interview questions
===================================================
1. What is Jenkins?
Answer: Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and automating various tasks in software development.

2. What is Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)?
Answer: Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests. Continuous Delivery extends this concept to automatically deploy code to production-like environments for testing and verification.

3.How do you install Jenkins?
Answer: Jenkins can be installed on various platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. It's often installed as a Java application by downloading the Jenkins 
WAR file and running it using Java.

4.What is a Jenkins pipeline?
Answer: A Jenkins pipeline is a set of instructions, written as code, that defines the steps required to build, test, and deploy applications. It allows you to define your entire CI/CD process in a single file or across multiple stages.

5.How do you define a Jenkins pipeline?
Answer: Jenkins pipelines can be defined using either Declarative or Scripted syntax. Declarative pipelines provide a simpler, more structured way to define pipelines, while Scripted pipelines offer more flexibility but may require more scripting knowledge.

6.What is the difference between a Jenkins freestyle project and a pipeline?
Answer: A freestyle project is a traditional Jenkins job that allows you to configure build steps using a graphical user interface. Pipelines, on the other hand, are defined as code and offer more flexibility, better version control, and the ability to handle complex workflows.

7.How do you trigger a Jenkins job?
Answer: Jenkins jobs can be triggered by various events, such as code commits, scheduled builds, manual triggers, or webhook notifications from version control systems.

8.What is the purpose of Jenkins plugins?
Answer: Jenkins plugins extend its functionality by adding new features, integrations, and capabilities. There are thousands of plugins available to support different tools, technologies, and processes.

9.How can you secure a Jenkins installation?
Answer: Jenkins can be secured using authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as integrating with LDAP, using role-based access control, and setting up HTTPS for secure communication.

10.What is the Jenkinsfile?
Answer: The Jenkinsfile is a text file that defines the pipeline as code. It's typically stored in version control along with the source code and allows you to define the entire CI/CD process.
